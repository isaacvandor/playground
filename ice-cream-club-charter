# Club Name: Ice Cream Club
Last Updated: 1/23/19

## Purpose
The purpose of our club is to educate members of the Olin community on the art of homemade ice cream through formal tastings.

## Membership
While membership is open to all students, we will ask members to RSVP to specific events in order for us to purchase the right amount of supplies.

## Officers and Roles
The club leadership will consist of 2-3 members who will be responsible for organizing events and purchasing materials needed.

## Transition Protocol
A transition protocol will take place if an underclassman expresses interest in taking over the club. Club leadership will be responsible for the process.

## Club Materials, purchases, and space
Events will be hosted in East Hall, most likely in a suite with closed doors, or a controlled lounge space. We will purchase some fresh ingredients for each event in addition to the necessary ingredients for ice cream. Funding will be requested for each individual event and will be based off of the number of people RSVPâ€™d for the event.

## Events and Activities
We plan to conduct several ice cream tastings throughout the semester. In addition we may do ice cream tasting and pairing events.

## Amendment Procedures
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment meets a favorable response and is supported by the leadership it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the CCO.
